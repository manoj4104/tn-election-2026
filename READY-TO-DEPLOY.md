#### Step 2: Push Your Code

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/election-2026.git
git push -u origin main
```

You may be asked for credentials - use your GitHub username and a **Personal Access Token** (not your password).

**Don't have a token?** Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"

2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
4. Find `YOUR_USERNAME/election-2026`
5. Click **"Import"**
6. Click **"Deploy"**

**Done!** ✨ Your site will be live in 2-3 minutes at:
`https://election-2026.vercel.app`

#### Alternative: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/start
2. Click **"Import from Git"**
3. Choose GitHub and authorize
4. Select `YOUR_USERNAME/election-2026`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when pushing to GitHub?
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Check: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication

### Build fails on Vercel/Netlify?
- Check the build logs
- Ensure Node.js version is 18 or higher
- Run `npm install && npm run build` locally first

### Database not working?
- For production, consider switching to PostgreSQL
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for database migration guide
