```

### Step 2: Login to Netlify

- `https://election-2026.netlify.app`

### Install Next.js Plugin

For better Next.js support, install the Netlify Next.js plugin:

```bash
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs
```

This is already configured in `netlify.toml`.

### Environment Variables

Add environment variables on Netlify:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com

## Alternative: Deploy via GitHub (Easiest for beginners)

### For Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/election-2026.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Go to https://vercel.com/new
3. Click "Import Git Repository"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Click "Deploy"

**Done!** Vercel automatically detects Next.js and configures everything.

### For Netlify:

1. Push your code to GitHub (same as above)
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/start
3. Click "Import from Git"
4. Select GitHub and authorize
5. Choose your repository
6. Click "Deploy site"

**Done!** Netlify will build and deploy automatically.

## Database Considerations

### SQLite (Current Setup)
- ‚úÖ Works fine for development and small sites
- ‚úÖ Included in deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to single instance (no scaling)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data resets on redeployment (Vercel/Netlify are ephemeral)

### Recommended for Production:

Use a managed database like:

1. **Vercel Postgres** (Vercel only)
   - Free tier: 256 MB
   - Automatic setup
   
2. **PlanetScale** (MySQL compatible)
   - Free tier: 5GB
   - Works with Vercel/Netlify
   
3. **Supabase** (PostgreSQL)
   - Free tier: 500 MB
   - Works with Vercel/Netlify

To switch to PostgreSQL:

1. Update `.env`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"
   ```

2. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"  // changed from sqlite
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma generate
   ```

## Automatic Deployments

Both Vercel and Netlify support automatic deployments:

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Every push to `main` branch ‚Üí automatic deployment
3. Pull requests ‚Üí preview deployments

**Setup:**
- Vercel: https://vercel.com/docs/git
- Netlify: https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails?
- Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
- Run `npm install` locally first
- Check build logs for errors

### Database errors?
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Run `npx prisma generate` before deploying
- Consider switching to PostgreSQL for production

### API routes not working?
- Check function configuration in `vercel.json` or `netlify.toml`
- Verify API routes are in `/app/api/` folder
